To give you a "Winning-Level" execution, the website needs to feel like a **live, breathing monitoring tool**, not just a static database.

Here is the complete operational overview of **PETMS (Public Expenditure Transparency & Monitoring System)**, integrating your original structure with the **Social Auditing** and **Geotagged Verification** enhancements.

## 🏗️ 1. The User Experience (The Three Pillars)

The website operates on a **Permission-Based Dashboard** system. Depending on who logs in, the entire interface shifts.

### 👤 The Citizen (The Watchdog)

* **Landing Page:** A high-impact "Public Map" showing their local area.
* **Action:** They can search for a project (e.g., "Main Street Bridge").
* **Social Audit:** They see the contractor’s claimed progress (e.g., "80% Complete"). If the bridge is clearly not done, the citizen hits **"Flag Discrepancy"** and uploads a live photo.
* **Upvote System:** If 100 citizens upvote a complaint about a specific pothole or delayed school, that project moves to the **"Critical"** section on the Admin’s desk.

### 👷 The Contractor (The Reporter)

* **Update Portal:** They don't just type numbers; they must upload a **Geotagged Image** to move the progress bar from 40% to 60%.
* **Financials:** They see their "Pending Tranche." If the project is "Red Flagged" by the system (due to delays or citizen complaints), their next payment is automatically "On Hold."

### 🏛️ The Admin/Government (The Auditor)

* **God-Eye View:** A heatmap of the state. Red zones indicate high corruption risk or massive delays.
* **Automated Alerts:** The system pings them: *"Alert: Project #402 has spent 95% budget but is only 30% complete. Investigate immediately."*

## ⚙️ 2. Core Logic: The "Intelligence" Layer

This is what you demo to the judges. It’s not just a website; it’s a **Decision Support System**.

### 🚩 The Red-Flag Engine (Logic Flow)

The backend runs a background cron job (or simple trigger) that calculates:


* **Logic:** If a project has spent  of its money but is only  done, the  spikes, the marker on the map turns **Bright Red**, and an email is sent to the Department Head.

### 📸 The Verification Logic (My Added Idea)

To prevent "Paper Progress" (lying on forms):

1. Contractor uploads an image of the road.
2. The system extracts **EXIF Data** (GPS Lats/Longs).
3. **Validation:** If the photo's GPS coordinates are  away from the actual project site, the upload is **Rejected**.

## 💻 3. Technical Roadmap (The "How it Works" Stack)

| Component | Tech Used | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Frontend** | React.js + Tailwind | Fast, responsive, and "Gov-Portal" professional look. |
| **Mapping** | Leaflet.js / OpenStreetMap | Plotting project coordinates visually. |
| **Data Viz** | Chart.js / Recharts | Turning boring budget numbers into visual "Burn-down" charts. |
| **Backend** | Node.js + Express | Handling the Red-Flag logic and API calls. |
| **Database** | MongoDB Atlas | Storing flexible project schemas and user roles. |
| **Storage** | Cloudinary / AWS S3 | To store the "Proof of Work" images uploaded by contractors. |

## 🗺️ 4. The "Winning" Sitemap (Structure)

1. **Home Page:**
* Big "Search Project" bar.
* Counter: "₹ Total Public Funds Monitored" | "✅ Projects Completed" | "⚠️ Active Red Flags."


2. **Explore Map:** * Full-screen interactive map with filters (Roads, Education, Health).
3. **Project Detail Page:**
* **The Progress Bar:** (Target vs. Actual).
* **The Money Trail:** Simple Bar chart showing "Allocated" vs. "Released" vs. "Spent."
* **Citizen Feed:** A "Timeline" of photos uploaded by both the contractor and the public.


4. **Complaint Portal:**
* Simple form with Image Upload + GPS capture.

## 🚀 5. Why this Execution Wins SIH

1. **Accountability:** You aren't just showing data; you are **verifying** it with GPS and Citizen feedback.
2. **Simplicity:** You use rule-based logic (If/Else) which is robust and easy to code in 12 hours, but you pitch it as "Predictive Risk Analysis."
3. **Scalability:** You can tell the judges: *"This can be integrated with the existing PFMS (Public Financial Management System) via API."*

## 🎯 Your Next Step

**Would you like me to write the React Component for the "Red Flag Dashboard" or the Node.js API logic that calculates the "Risk Score"?**
