🏆 What Makes It Win

💰 Project Title
Public Expenditure Transparency & Monitoring System (PETMS)
🏛 1️⃣ Problem Background

In India, large amounts of government funds are allocated every year for:

Roads

Schools

Hospitals

Smart city projects

Rural infrastructure

However:

Citizens cannot track how funds are being used.

There is limited transparency in spending.

Delays and cost overruns go unnoticed.

No centralized public dashboard exists.

Corruption risks increase due to lack of visibility.

🎯 2️⃣ SIH-Style Problem Statement

Design and develop a web-based platform that ensures transparency in public expenditure by enabling citizens to monitor government project allocations, track spending, identify delays, and flag suspicious budget discrepancies in real-time.

The system should:

Display project-wise fund allocation and usage

Show timeline tracking

Provide automated red-flag alerts

Allow citizens to raise complaints

Offer analytics dashboards for administrators

💡 3️⃣ Proposed Solution

We propose a centralized web portal where:

Government officials upload project details

Contractors update progress

Citizens view live dashboards

System auto-detects suspicious patterns

Data is visualized through charts and maps

🧱 4️⃣ System Architecture (Simple & Effective)

Frontend:

React + Tailwind

Chart.js

Leaflet Maps

Backend:

Node.js

Express

MongoDB Atlas

Deployment:

Frontend → Vercel

Backend → Render

Architecture Flow:

User → React Frontend → Express API → MongoDB
System Logic → Red Flag Detection Engine

🗄 5️⃣ Database Schema (Important)
Users Collection

_id

name

email

password

role (admin / contractor / citizen)

Projects Collection

_id

title

department

location

totalBudget

amountSpent

completionPercentage

startDate

expectedEndDate

status (On Time / Delayed)

riskFlag (true/false)

Complaints Collection

_id

projectId

citizenId

description

imageURL

status (Pending / Resolved)

🌐 6️⃣ Feature Breakdown
🔐 1. Role-Based Authentication

Admin:

Add projects

View analytics

Update budget

Contractor:

Update progress

Upload reports

Citizen:

View projects

Raise complaints

📊 2. Dashboard

Show:

Total funds allocated

Total funds used

Number of delayed projects

Number of risky projects

Use:
Chart.js for:

Pie chart (Budget usage)

Bar chart (Department spending)

Line chart (Monthly trends)

🚨 3. Red Flag Detection (Winning Feature)

Add automatic risk detection logic:

IF:

amountSpent > 90% AND completion < 50%

project delayed > 30 days

sudden budget increase > 20%

THEN:
riskFlag = true

Display:
⚠️ High Risk Badge on dashboard

This looks like AI but is rule-based (easy to build).

📍 4. Map View

Use Leaflet:

Show project locations

Green marker = healthy

Red marker = risk

Yellow marker = delayed

Judges LOVE visual maps.

📝 5. Complaint System

Citizen:

Select project

Upload description + image

Track status

Admin:

View complaints

Mark resolved

🎤 8️⃣ How To Present (This Wins Hackathons)

Start with:

"India allocates lakhs of crores annually to public projects, but citizens lack visibility into how funds are utilized. Our system ensures transparency, accountability, and corruption risk detection."

Then demo:

Dashboard overview

Risk flagged project

Map visualization

Complaint submission

Admin analytics

Keep demo under 4 minutes.

🏆 9️⃣ Why This Can Win

✔ Strong social impact
✔ Government relevance
✔ Transparency focus
✔ Data visualization heavy
✔ Looks like production-ready system
✔ Not just CRUD — has intelligence

💎 Extra Boost (If Time Left)

Add:

Download report as PDF

Dark mode toggle

Export data as CSV

Simple predictive graph (fake but realistic demo)

🚀 Final Advice

In hackathons:

Judges don’t reward complexity.
They reward:

Problem clarity

Clean UI

Real-world impact

Strong explanation

Your project checks all 4.
